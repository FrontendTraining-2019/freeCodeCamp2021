# 2021 - My New Coding Journey

<img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/750/1*eDaRLwBlwmjCpkeeqRM4vw.png">

For the new year I've finally decided that it's time for me to earn a few of the free verified certifications offered by freeCodeCamp. freeCodeCamp offers a total of ten various certifications in a variety of different subjects ranging from Responsive Web Design to Data Visualization to Machine Learning with Python. Each certification covers up to 300 hours web development training that one would need to learn to become a Full-Stack Web Developer. My ultimate goal for this year is to complete at least four out of the ten certifications. The four certifications that I'm going to complete will be:

  - Responsive Web Design Certification
  - JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification
  - Front End Libraries Certification
  - Data Visualization Certification

In order to complete these certifications, I plan to code every day rain or shine. This might be hard to accomplish, but I'm gonna do my best to rise to the occasion. I'll be using this repo and others to keep track of the various projects that I would have to complete for each certification.
