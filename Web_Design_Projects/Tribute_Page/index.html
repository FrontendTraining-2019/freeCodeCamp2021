        A time line of Doris Miller's life and achievements:
      </h3>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Miller was born in <strong>Waco, Texas</strong> on October 12, 1919, to Connery and Hennitta Miller.
        </li>

        <li>
          He was 3 of 4 sons and helped around the house, cooked meals and did laundry, as well as working on the family farm.
        </li>

        <li>
          On September 16, 1939, Miller decided to enlist in the United States Navy after dropping out of highschool because he was forced to repeat the 8th grade.
        </li>

        <li>
          He did his training at Naval Station Norfolk in Virginia, then was promoted to Mess Attendant Third Class, one of the few ratings open at the time to black sailors. After training school, he was assigned to the ammunition ship Pyro and then transferred on January 2, 1940 to the battleship <strong>West Viriginia</strong>.
        </li>

        <li>
          On December 7, 1947, Miller was serving on the battleship West Viriginia in Pearl Harbor when Japanese forces attacked. Miller carried injured soldiers to safety and then operated the ship's guns to defend his crew. Afterward, the media dubbed Miller the "unnamed Negro mess man hero" until President Franklin D. Roosevelt made him the first black man awarded the Navy Cross -- the U.S. military's second-highest decoration awarded for valor in combat.
        </li>

        <li>
          In the Negro world Dorie Miller became an idol. Negro organizations began a campaign to honor Miller with additional recognition. On April 4, the Pittsburgh Courier urged readers to write to members of the congressional Naval Affairs Committee in support of awarding the Medal of Honor to Miller. There are fan clubs organized for him and songs written about him.
        </li>

        <li>
          Doris Miller's legacy paved the way for other African-American service members to serve in combat roles. And his likeness was used in Navy recruitment drives, including an iconic World War II enlistment poster featuring the words, "Above and beyond the call of duty."

          "This marks the first time in this conflict that such high tribute has been made in the Pacific Fleet to a member of his race and I'm sure the future will see others similarly honored for brave acts."
